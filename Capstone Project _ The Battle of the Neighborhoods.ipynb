    "In this project I will provide an optimal location to live in a city. An optimal location in this study is one with a variety of venues/amenities within close proximity. Ideally, a resident would choose a loction within close proximity to his/her workplace.  Thus, various venues will be categorized on the basis of their distance between the most prominent workplace/industril zones in the city.  I will cluster the locales in the region based on ideal living locations.  This report specifically targets stakeholders who are interested in finding a livable location in Pune City, India."
